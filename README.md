# imagenerics

An imaginary library for an imaginary Go feature

This library demonstrates what some packages made possible by the generics draft design might look like:

https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/4a54a00950b56dd0096482d0edae46969d7432a6/design/go2draft-contracts.md

It has no real purpose other than being a thought exercise.

## How to Use

Using this library couldn't be easier:

* Imagine a version of Go that has support for generics.
* Imagine building your code with that version of Go.
* Imagine using this library in your code.

That's it! All the documentation (and code) is in the various subdirectory README files. Go have a look!

## Playground

If you want to actually try writing and running generic code, you may have some luck in the WASM playground here:

It is, however, extremely experimental.
