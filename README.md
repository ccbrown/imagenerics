# imagenerics

An imaginary library for an imaginary Go feature

## How to Use

Using this library couldn't be easier:

* Imagine a version of Go that has support for generics.
* Imagine building your code with that version of Go.
* Imagine using this library in your code.

That's it! All the documentation (and code) is in the various subdirectory README files. Go have a look!
